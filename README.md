## About App:
This is a small web application that shows data about the Star Wars universe.

This is the project created during my education in Codecool.<br/>
**The goal was to:**

  * HTML/CSS, JS
  * AJAX
  * DOM manipulation
  * web design
* store data (Login and voting informations) in a local database (PostgreSQL)
* use Flask as a back-end
* fetch information about Star Wars from https://swapi.co API (This site provides an endpoint with no authentication needed)
* create a simple user login system with sessions
* create a voting system (User can vote for planets)


## Used technology:
* Flask 
* Python (Postgres with Psycopg)
